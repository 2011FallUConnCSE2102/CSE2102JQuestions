JQuestions 0.9.1

Overview.

  JQuestions is an advanced exam simulator program for self-testing, 
learning and education. It is able to ask multi-choice and drag-and-drop 
type questions and has a variety of configuration features which make it 
ideal for revision, exam preparation, and general learning.

  I've already made several releases at home but this is the first 
version I've uploaded to Sourceforge. This release is version 0.9.1
and should be considered 'beta'.
