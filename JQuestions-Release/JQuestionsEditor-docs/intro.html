                                <h1>What is JQuestions ?</h1>

				<P>JQuestions is an advanced exam simulator system for self-testing, 
learning and education. It is able to ask multi-choice and drag-and-drop type questions and has a 
variety of configuration features which make it ideal for revision, exam preparation, and general 
learning.

<P>It has been deliberately written to be a small, simple to use, stand-alone piece of software. 
It depends on no other programs, database software or libraries being installed except for Java. 
It can be run as either a desktop application or as a Java Applet embedded within a browser. Despite 
it's small size, it offers a full range of configuration options and features, such as timers, 
embedding pictures in questions, optional immediate feedback to users, optional 'hints' may be set 
for users, results printing, answer-shuffling to prevent 'visually' remembering answers, and allowing 
up to 50 possible answers to each question.


<P>
All the code is written in standard Java 6. It is publicly available, open-source code which 
can be freely downloaded from the project's home page, 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jquestions">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jquestions</a>.

                                  <div class="SECT2">
                                    <h2 class="SECT2">Who Is It For?</h2>

<P>The JQuestions system is ideal for anyone who is studying, or who wants to learn a new subject 
or area. It is suited for self-learning, self-teaching and education. You can use it to create 
your own questions and tests on <i>any</i> subject, which you can keep and re-use at anytime. 
In this way you can build up your own library of tests and exams. 

<P>
You can also swap JQS files with other people and JQuestions users. The definition of the JQS file format 
is open, publicly available and non-proprietary. This means that anyone else is also free to write
their own applications programs to use and interact with JQS files, for whatever reason (e.g. to 
write a version for mobile devices, for instance), should they want to.

                                    <h2 class="SECT2">JQuestions, the JQuestions Editor, and the .JQS File Format</h2>


<P>The JQuestions system consists of three elements: 
<ol>
<li><B>JQuestions.</B>The exam simulator program which is highly configurable and can run in either 'Quiz mode' 
(where feedback, hints and explanations are available to the user), or in 'Exam mode' where no help or feedback 
is given. When it runs, the exam-simulator draws its questions in random order from the question pool.</li>
<li><B>JQuestions Editor.</B>The Editor program is used to create and edit questions and to manipulate JQS files.</li>
<li><B>JQS File Format.</B>The JQS file format is important because it is in the public domain and is an open format.
This means other people are also free to write their own applications programs to use and interact 
with JQS files, for whatever reason (e.g. to write a version for mobile devices, for instance), should they choose to.</li>
</ol>

<P>It is hoped that the openness of the JQS file format will enable the free sharing and exchange of information in 
a similar way to which the MP3 file format has facilitated the sharing and exchange of audio files.

                                  <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="Version" id="Version">Latest Version</a></h2>

<P>At the time of writing the current version of JQuestions is 0.9.1. This version is stable and in BETA 
testing. News, updates, upgrades and support are available from the project home page at 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jquestions">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jquestions</a>.
